**AIM**

I have embarked on an extraordinary educational opportunity via the MyDFIR SOC Community Program a community created for emerging cybersecurity professionals to engage with real-world challenges, and develop key skills with a hands-on approach.

I am presently engaged in the Microsoft 30-Day Challenge, which is one of the major learning activities in the SOC curriculum, as part of this program.


With this reflection on my experience, I'm not only documenting the progress I'm making technically, but I'm also showing how successful I can be using the SOC methodology in real-world contexts. This is enabling me to solidify my understanding of cybersecurity and develop my operational effectiveness in tangible ways I can showcase. 

**Project Outline**


This repository documents my personal experience through the Microsoft 30-Day Challenge, a project in which I design and operate a Security Operations Center (SOC) completely in the cloud. Using Microsoft Sentinel and the integrated security tools available, I am building a modern SOC environment from scratch.


During the challenge, the emphasis will be on building skills in cloud-based threat detection and response, and gaining hands-on experience with phishing investigation, alert triage, and incident reporting.					

**Technologies  Used**

Microsoft Sentinel – Core SIEM/SOAR platform

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint – Endpoint threat protection

Microsoft 365 Security Center – Email and identity security

Microsoft Azure – Infrastructure and environment management
