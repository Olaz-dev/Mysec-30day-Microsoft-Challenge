**AIM**

I have embarked on an extraordinary educational opportunity via the MyDFIR SOC Community Program a community created for emerging cybersecurity professionals to engage with real-world challenges, and develop key skills with a hands-on approach.

I am presently engaged in the Microsoft 30-Day Challenge, which is one of the major learning activities in the SOC curriculum, as part of this program.


With this reflection on my experience, I'm not only documenting the progress I'm making technically, but I'm also showing how successful I can be using the SOC methodology in real-world contexts. This is enabling me to solidify my understanding of cybersecurity and develop my operational effectiveness in tangible ways I can showcase.
